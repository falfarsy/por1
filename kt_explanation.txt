This illusion consists of the Brain as seeing the empty space in the middle
as brighter than the background which causes an inverted triangle with a black
outline to appear along with a normal ‘white’ triangle. Of course, these shapes
don’t actually exist. This can be explained using Gestalt's Law of closure.
This states that objects that are grouped together tend to be seen as being
part of a whole. We tend to ignore gaps and perceive the contour lines in
order to make the image appear as a cohesive whole.
