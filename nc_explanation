You can experience the cube in two distinct ways:
1.With the yellow face being the front of the cube, facing in the top left
direction.
2.With the yellow face being the back of the cube, with the rest of the cube
coming out in the right direction.
You can change one orientation to the other by simply thinking about it,
however you cannot ‘hold’ one orientation for very long.
The first interpretation the Brain makes which is incorrect is that the shape
is 3D, although we consciously know that the cube is
a bunch of flat lines on a screen. These lines could potentially be interpreted
as something else other than a cube. However, the 
brain sees the cube as the most likely interpretations.
The brain sees both orientations as equally likely. Disruptions of any sort
(eg. blinking, eye-movements, top-down commands) causes
the orientations to ‘flip’.
