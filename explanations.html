    If you see a duck, look at the beak and imagine it as rabbit ears.
    If you see a rabbit, look at the the ears and imagine them as a duck’s beak. 
    There is disagreement on how this illusions works, whether it is the
    visual experience that changes when seeing a rabbit vs. a duck or the
    mental process that changes, for example due to expectations prior to
    looking at the image or after the first experience. However,
    the retinal image is agreed to stay constant.

    This illusion consists of the Brain as seeing the empty space in the middle
    as brighter than the background which causes an inverted triangle with a black
    outline to appear along with a normal ‘white’ triangle. Of course, these shapes
    don’t actually exist. This can be explained using Gestalt's Law of closure.
    This states that objects that are grouped together tend to be seen as being
    part of a whole. We tend to ignore gaps and perceive the contour lines in
    order to make the image appear as a cohesive whole.

        You can experience the cube in two distinct ways:
        1.With the yellow face being the front of the cube, facing in the top left
        direction.
        2.With the yellow face being the back of the cube, with the rest of the cube
        coming out in the right direction.
        You can change one orientation to the other by simply thinking about it,
        however you cannot ‘hold’ one orientation for very long.
        The first interpretation the Brain makes which is incorrect is that the shape
        is 3D, although we consciously know that the cube is
        a bunch of flat lines on a screen. These lines could potentially be interpreted
        as something else other than a cube. However, the 
        brain sees the cube as the most likely interpretations.
        The brain sees both orientations as equally likely. Disruptions of any sort
        (eg. blinking, eye-movements, top-down commands) causes
        the orientations to ‘flip’.
